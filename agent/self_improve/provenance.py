"""
Skill write-origin provenance — ContextVar for distinguishing agent-created
skill writes from foreground user-directed writes.

移植自 hermes-agent/tools/skill_provenance.py

The curator only consolidates/prunes skills autonomously created via the
background self-improvement review fork. Skills a user asks a foreground
agent to write belong to the user and must never be auto-curated.

Usage:
    from agent.self_improve.provenance import (
        set_current_write_origin,
        reset_current_write_origin,
        get_current_write_origin,
    )

    token = set_current_write_origin("background_review")
    try:
        ...  # tool runs here
    finally:
        reset_current_write_origin(token)

    # inside a tool:
    if is_background_review():
        mark_agent_created(skill_name)
